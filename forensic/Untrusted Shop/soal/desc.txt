Untrusted Shop
==========================

Last night, I bought a new laptop in Bagas1337 Shop and the employee's quite nice when offering me to install windows installation for free. But I find it annoying when I want to search or navigate through folders or files inside my OS, there's this weird pop-ups always exist in my display screen but it won't disappear even tough I obeyed its instruction. Can you take a look at it? I dumped the process memory of my OS so you can investigate it.

Download the file:

Objectives:

1. What's the executable's name that likely to be the ROOT CAUSE of the infection? (include the extension)
example: bagas1337.exe

2. There's also another malicious file which responsibles for the annoying popups. It also has a capability
to reserve a certain memory that MIGHT execute a SHELLCODE in a memory buffer. What's the MD5 hash of the decrypted buffer?
example: 21232f297a57a5a743894a0e4a801fc3

Flag is wrapped with hology5{} with concatenated answers inside the curly brackets.
example: `hology5{bagas31.exe_21232f297a57a5a743894a0e4a801fc3}`
