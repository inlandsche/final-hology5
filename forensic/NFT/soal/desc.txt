NFT
==================================

Potsu just created a cute cat meme NFT image with a really cool hology flag but the app's that the NFT was created is crashed.
Potsu's friend, sl0ck decided to create a minidump of it , and hopefully you as the NFT community supporter can recover the image to Potsu and sl0ck will pay you 73.31% !

Download the MiniDump from here:

Flag format: hology5{.*}

Notes: Potsu realized that the closing curly bracket (}) message is missing in the image :( so you need to
add it on your own!
